# SAS Container Recipes
Using containers to build, customize, and deploy a SAS environment based on your software order.

## Getting Started
The `viya-visuals` directory is tailored for most large organizations, offering details for cluster deployments using Kubernetes.

The `viya-programming/single-container/` directory is tailored for most independent data scientists, with a quickstart for running a SAS Studio + CAS (Cloud Analytic Software) locally on your own machine.

The `viya-programming/multi-container` shares the same process as viya-visuals.

## Documentation
Check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-container-recipes/wiki) for other details.
Have a quick question? Open a ticket in the "issues" tab to get a response from the maintainers and other community members. If you're unsure about something just submit an issue anyways. We're glad to help!
If you have a specific license question head over to the [support portal](https://support.sas.com/en/support-home.html).

## Additional Features
The `addons` directory provides details for utilizing data access tools, authentication, security, and third-party extras.
