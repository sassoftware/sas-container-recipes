# When sas_install_java is set to true, the deployment will install the SAS 
# default Java and use this Java during processing. If Java is
# already available on the system, set sas_install_java to false and define 
# the path in sasenv_java_home below. When sas_install_java
# is set to false and a custom path is not provided in sasenv_java_home, 
# the deployment will look for Java via the JAVA_HOME environment 
# variable first and if Java is not found, the deployment will look 
# at "which java". In the case that no Java is found and sas_install_java
# is set to false, this will stop the deployment.
#
# If sas_install_java is set to true and Java is already on the system,
# for Linux hosts the Java alternatives may change once the SAS deployment 
# is complete. Once the deployment completes, validate that the Java alternatives 
# are correct for your environment. If this action is not desired, set 
# sas_install_java to false and install Java prior to running the SAS 
# deployment and set the path to Java in sasenv_java_home.

# If not set, the deployment will use the Java defined on the host.

# Define the users so they can be created. The block includes user ID cas which should remain
# so that SSH keys can be assigned to it. If you did not create a cas user named "cas", replace
# "cas" below with the user you did create. Recreate the same block for any other users you
# want to add. See the deployment guide for more information.
# To assign a password, here is a way to create the password. 
# This will require the passlib library to be installed: sudo yum install python-passlib
#   At a command line prompt run:
#     python -c "from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; import getpass; print sha512_crypt.encrypt(getpass.getpass(), rounds=10000)"
#   Take the value that is returned and paste it inbetween the single quotes below. Example:
#     password: 'secret'
# If setup_home is set to true, will use the values of shell and home when creating the user
