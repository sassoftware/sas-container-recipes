## Contributing

#### Reporting Security Issues
We take security seriously. To report a security issue, contact us at
[support@sas.com](mailto:support@sas.com).

#### Reporting Other Issues or Suggesting Improvements
Check our [GitHub issues section](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-container-recipes/issues)
to see if the problem or suggestion exists before submitting a new issue. When creating a new 
issue there are options to select a ticket format: "Flag Security Issue", "Report Problem", 
or "Suggest Improvement". These standard ticket templates assist in communicating all relevant
details, or you can select "Open a regular issue" to skip the ticket formats.

#### Pull Requests
Have something cool to share? SAS gladly accepts pull requests on GitHub!
If you're unsure how to open a pull request then see [GitHub's collaboration
guide](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/).

**Commit Messages**

Git commit messages should follow best practices, with a maximum of 50 characters 
explaining the context of your change and a brief summary of what has changed.

**Code Review Process**

Maintainers and community members will review your changes and possibly make
requests for improvement. Multiple maintainers are required to approve changes
before they are merged into the project.

All code must be properly formatted with any relevant formatting tools.
For example, code written in Go should be formatted by the `gofmt` tool (`gofmt -w *.go`)

Tip: Vim users can add `au BufWritePost *.go !gofmt -w %` to their `~/.vimrc`
