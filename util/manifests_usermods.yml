# In the following structure, define the deployment_overrides per service that
# you want to end up in the generated manifests. This will add to or replace defaults
# For each service.deployment_overrides section, you can define the following:
#
# - environments
# - secrets
# - volumes
# - volume mounts
#
# Note: when uncommenting this section, use caution not to change the relative indentation
# of the blocks. The indentation of 'environment', 'volumes', and 'volume_mounts' should all
# match (6 spaces). Also, the embedded comment block may be removed.

#      # In the following structures, define the custom volumes and volume mounts that
